// The modern mode, "use strict"
// For a long time, JavaScript evolved without compatibility issues. 
// New features were added to the language while old functionality didn’t change.

// That had the benefit of never breaking existing code. 
// But the downside was that any mistake or an imperfect decision made 
// by JavaScript’s creators got stuck in the language forever.

// This was the case until 2009 when ECMAScript 5 (ES5) appeared. 
// It added new features to the language and modified some of the existing ones. 
// To keep the old code working, most such modifications are off by default. 
// You need to explicitly enable them with a special directive: "use strict".
