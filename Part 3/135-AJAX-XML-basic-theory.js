// BASIC THEORY 

// AJAX : asynchronous javascript and XML

// HTTP request
// client and server uses HTTP for communicating
// client is browser which mostly always uses JS in client 
// side that is frontend

// What is AJAX?
// AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It is not a programming language. 
// It is a technology for developing better, faster and interactive 
// Web Applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and XML.


// AJAX is a set of "web development techniques" 
// using many web technologies on the "client-side "
// to create asynchronous web applications. 
// suppose we want to read or get data from server 
// this happens asynchronously and browser does this 

// With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve 
// data from a server asynchronously (in the background) 
// without interfering with the display and 
// behaviour of the existing page

// What's the meaning of Asynchronous in AJAX?
// Asynchronous means that the the Web Application could send and receive data from the 
// Web Server without refreshing the page. This background process of sending and receiving data 
// from the server along with updating different sections of a web page defines
// Asynchronous property/feature of AJAX.

// We don't use data in XML format anymore. 
// we use JSON now. 

// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
// 1.) xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing) ( xhr )
// 2.) fetch API (new way of doing)
// 3.) axios (this is third party library)
